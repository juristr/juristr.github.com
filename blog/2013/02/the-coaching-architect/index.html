<p>In this talk, <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyOsherove">Roy Osherove</a> speaks about how to become a better coach. A nice talk highlighting some of my personal principles I try to follow every day. Coaching others is a nice thing if you like it, but it also needs to be learned.</p>

<h3 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>Ok&hellip;, so <a href="#conclusion">jump here</a> then.</p>

<h2 id="talk-notes">Talk Notes</h2>

<p>Here are my notes I took during the talk.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<ul>
<li>for some people, the definition of an architect is to make things right, to make sure everything goes well; to do things in the best way possible</li>
<li>lot of architects fail because they cannot get their message across</li>
<li>architect is a type of leader (in the area of design, architecture,&hellip;)</li>
<li>wishes (feeling they&rsquo;ll never come true): that team does practice TDD,&hellip;</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="you-are-the-bottleneck">You are the Bottleneck</h3>

<ul>
<li>leader: one that is a bottleneck; a person to ask, to get answers</li>
<li>being an architect makes you by definition a bottleneck</li>
<li>problem: you never have time to learn new things, to create new stuff because you have become a bottleneck</li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re asked to create a framework, don&rsquo;t do it if not absolutely needed. Instead, try to teach devs how to do it s.t. they get more independent. Otherwise you create another layer of ice between your mates</li>
<li>Wrong: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one that can do it/knows how to do it&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="role-of-a-leader">Role of a leader</h3>

<ul>
<li>make yourself unneeded (to remove yourself as bottleneck)</li>
<li>create people around you with your knowledge, don&rsquo;t just be someone that provides guidance</li>
<li>if you work with a team and after your work they didn&rsquo;t learn anything new, you failed, you missed the point of why you&rsquo;re there, what you get paid for</li>
<li>grow the team that you have into the <strong>team you want to have</strong></li>
<li>creating a self-organizing team, doesn&rsquo;t mean you get fired &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re no more needed:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>By growing others to not need you, you will always be wanted, appreciated and highly valuable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="leadership-is-tough">Leadership is tough</h3>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I want it to solve it yourself&rdquo;; this doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re not doing your job, on the contrary, you&rsquo;re teaching them how to solve it on their own, hence, you help them to grow and get better</li>
<li>coach them to learn, otherwise they&rsquo;ll always come back to you and ask for that solution</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-grow-people-learning">How to grow people - Learning</h3>

<p>Observations have shown that there are periods of slow learning followed by periods of very quick learning. The reason for such <strong>ravines before the fast growth</strong> are because we first need to &ldquo;unlearn&rdquo; what we knew before in order to be able to acquire new knowledge and try something new. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>when switching programming language: initially stupid, but then - knowing different programming languages - you know different kind of patterns, different viewpoints which make you more productive; teach you to think about a problem from various angles</li>
<li>when starting with TDD. Initially you&rsquo;re awfully slow and you seem to not move ahead. But once you got it, your performance and quality of code will increase drammatically.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>To grow the team, we must first realize we can do this ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mentoring others needs to be learned&hellip;in fact, it might be uncomfortable initially. But in the end, the process of mentoring is a learning process for both, the mentor and the coached person.</p>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<p>Common symptoms: Others will do the task much slower than myself</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The key is to make time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are different kind of modes</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>survival mode -</strong> most teams are here; there is never time, to learn or practice new things; not to do TDD, not to write unit tests etc&hellip;this is a self-perpetuating mode: since you never have time to do TDD, you don&rsquo;t write unit tests and hence your code quality will drammatically reduce, introducing new bugs which again take time to fix etc&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>learning mode -</strong> having enough time to learn and practice new things and actually using that time properly. <em>That&rsquo;s the stage where you can be a coach.</em><br />
Make time: increase tasks by at least 50% in order to create space to practice something new (i.e. Unit Testing).</li>
<li><strong>self-organizing mode -</strong> when doing enough learning, people will start solving their own problems and hence get &ldquo;self-organizing&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="triangle-of-quality">Triangle of Quality</h3>

<p>Goal is to not only have two of them, but all three: features, time and quality.</p>

<p>Again, same rule, try to avoid being the bottleneck. You&rsquo;ll never be able to review all the code of your peers and as such, you have to teach them how to do it by themselves (shared code ownership).</p>

<p>How do we lose quality? Dilemma:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write tests, or get it done? Answer: Let it fix quickly and get the thing done. Feeling = good</li>
<li>Another thing happening? Again, write tests or get done?? Last time? -&gt; fix quickly -&gt; so continue that way; Feeling = good; Result: year later: code sucks</li>
</ol>

<p>But, &ldquo;the project is going to take 3 weeks without unit tests and 4 weeks with unit tests&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
There is <strong>no</strong> choice, this <strong>is the way things are done</strong>. It&rsquo;s the same as saying &ldquo;the car costs $20,000 without wheels and $30,000 with them&rdquo;.<br />
<strong>Stand up for the values you believe you&rsquo;re right.</strong></p>

<h3 id="understand-why-behaviors-don-t-work">Understand why behaviors don&rsquo;t work</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>For each behavior, The world is perfectly designed for that behavior to happen (Influencer - the power to change anything)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are different reasons why people may not follow certain behaviors.</p>

<ol>
<li>Personal

<ul>
<li>Motivation</li>
<li>Ability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social

<ul>
<li>Motivation</li>
<li>Ability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Environmental

<ul>
<li>Motivation</li>
<li>Ability</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Social motivation</strong> are the people that draw you into a certain action. This is strongly related to group membership. As such, creating a support group might be helpful in convincing people to acquire certain behaviors (like doing TDD).</p>

<p><strong>Environmental ability</strong> define the infrastructure around you, i.e. having an automated build server that executes the test you write in the process of performing TDD.<br />
<strong>Environmental motivation</strong> on the other hand is strongly related to rewards. For instance, people might get rewarded for being able to quickly ship a task. As such, others, writing unit tests and thus shipping a bit more slowly, might get the feeling that their work isn&rsquo;t  As such, doing a good job by writing automated tests for your code seem not to be appreciated.</p>

<h3 id="common-language">Common Language</h3>

<p>The words we use when we promise something. Saying what you want to do, meaning it and to actually make it true.</p>

<p><strong>Bad</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We need&hellip;</li>
<li>I could&hellip;</li>
<li>Why doesn&rsquo;t someone&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>All of them give you a way out, a &ldquo;permission&rdquo; to not do it.</p>

<p><strong>Better</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I will&hellip;by&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates a commitment of something real. Moreover if people have a problem saying it, you&rsquo;ll immediately know there might be problems (due to time constraints or whatever). So you can react on that. It helps to raise problems that might exist inside a team.</p>

<p>But attention, you can make people to <strong>only commit to things that are under their own control</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be a bottleneck</strong>, <strong>coach</strong> the people around you. When people come to you about a problem, challenge them in order to help them learn and grow: &ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Know how learning works</strong> and how you can <strong>allocate time</strong> in order to create spaces for learning and for moving people out of &ldquo;survival mode&rdquo; into &ldquo;learning mode&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Consider also potential problems that hinder the adopton of new practivces and their potential <strong>personal, social or environmental barriers</strong>.</p>

<p>Also employ <strong>common language</strong> which leads to more clear commitments.</p>
