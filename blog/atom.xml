      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://juristr.com/blog/2021/06/read-render-markdown-nextjs-and-nx/&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, we explored how to render Markdown with Next.js as well as how Nx can help by moving the markdown-related processing logic into its own library. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore how to dynamically hydrate React components with MDX and Next.js.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    In the previous article, we looked into how to setup &lt;a href=&#34;https://juristr.com/blog/2021/06/setup-tailwind-nextjs-and-nx&#34;&gt;Tailwind with Next.js and Nx workspace&lt;/a&gt;.
In this article we are going to learn how to use Next.js to read files from the file system, to parse the Markdown, and to render it to HTML. In particular, we&amp;rsquo;re going to see how Nx helps us generate code and organize the features into Nx libraries. Rendering Markdown files is an essential part of creating a JAMStack application. For our blog platform, we are going to write articles in Markdown, which should then be parsed and rendered properly.

    In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://juristr.com/blog/2021/06/create-nextjs-webapp-nx&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; we learned how to setup Next.js in an Nx workspace. In this article we carry that forward, by adding &lt;a href=&#34;https://tailwindcss.com/&#34;&gt;TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt; support to our setup.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore how to create our very first web application with Next.js and Nx. We&amp;rsquo;re going to learn about the anatomy of a Nx based workspace, how to generate one, and specifically how to setup our Next.js application. Finally, we&amp;rsquo;re also going to create our blog&amp;rsquo;s about page and learn about some handy Next.js features.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    Since I get this question often, why not write it down! What we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at in this article is lazy loading in Angular, but in specific about the &amp;ldquo;common chunk&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;commonChunk&amp;rdquo; option in the Angular builder configuration.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    Apart from the framework itself, one outcome from Google&amp;rsquo;s Angular team is for sure the tooling. One important tooling feature is the ability to automatically upgrade Angular codebases across breaking changes. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how that works and why it is important.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this already happened to you as well. You pull down the latest &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch or jump to some feature branch and you start getting weird errors. Until only later you recognize you forgot to execute an &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s look into how we can avoid that.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    I think partial commits should be avoided as they might lead to inconsistent commits if you don&amp;rsquo;t test them properly. But sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re handy too. In this article I&amp;rsquo;m quickly showing how partial commits can be done in Webstorm.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    One of the core pieces of &lt;a href=&#34;https://nx.dev&#34;&gt;Nx&lt;/a&gt; are libraries. They enable to seamlessly share functionality across various apps and other libs within the monorepository. Exporting code is easy, but how can we export things like assets?

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    Jest has become the goto testing framework in the frontend space, whether it is for React or for Angular. In Nx it is even the default choice when generating a new Angular app. Debugging can be a bit more cumbersome though, in contrast to Karma. Let&amp;rsquo;s see.

    Git is an &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; technology if you want that has been around for ages now. Still, when speaking or collaborating with other software developers, I always again see them struggle with apparently basic commands. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be scary. In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going to quickly walk you through the difference between &amp;ldquo;merge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rebase&amp;rdquo;.

    This year I again had the pleasure to come back to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ng-be.org/&#34;&gt;ng-be&lt;/a&gt; as a speaker. Since I see a lot of people struggle with creating proper forms, especially large forms, I gave a talk about how to optimize your Angular Reactive Forms with the help of &lt;a href=&#34;https://formly.dev/&#34;&gt;ngx-formly&lt;/a&gt;.

Today in this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to exclusively focus on how to approach lazy loading of an Angular Module in a way that is compatible with ViewEngine and Ivy.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    Do you remember how in AngularJS (v1.x) we could easily debug/change the state of our components from the browser&amp;rsquo;s devtools. Guess what: now with Ivy a new easy API returns that openes up a variety of new ways. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how that works.

Testing (in particular automated testing) can come with different flavors and at different levels. In this article I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a quick overview of automated UI or end-2-end testing with Cypress.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    Input Validation is a big topic when it comes to forms. And even more in those large, enterprisey apps, where validation can become really crazy. Now, Angular forms of course provide different mechanisms for handling validation out of the box. However, in this article I won&amp;rsquo;t go into those details, I will rather show you a possible strategy for visualizing server side validation errors.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
  When you create dynamic UIs, you have to deal with async stuff a lot. Most often they are triggered by some user interaction. Things usually get tricky when you need to guarantee certain operations are executed in order. Since they are async we might not know which one returns first. Let&#39;s see how RxJS can help a lot here.

      <title>Why You Should Avoid a Canonical Data Model</title>

      <guid>https://juristr.com/blog/2015/08/link-why-avoid-canonical-datamodels/</guid>
      <description>Stefan Tilkov writes about why canonical data models can be a bad thing. Totally agree as I&amp;rsquo;ve come across this by myself as well.
Instead of trying to define one model for the entire application/service landscape, it would rather be a lot more productive to focus and define the data responsibility.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you heard about Angular 2 and that it will be totally different. Forget everything you know and start from scratch 😮 . Jokes apart, if you have taken a closer look you already know that, yes, it will be new, things will be different (as it&amp;rsquo;s mostly the case with new stuff), but many concepts will still be there.</description>

      <description>When you create isolated directives, you usually use the scope property to define your directive&#39;s external API. Some of the APIs properties might be mandatory while others are optional and based on that state, your directive might react differently.</description>

Although it might often seem an unnecessary overhead, it&amp;rsquo;s highly suggested (even when you communicate within your own systems) as you don&amp;rsquo;t want to depend on the internal structure of another service.</description>

      <description>Developers need to have fast&amp;nbsp;machines!&amp;nbsp;Today I just returned from a week of holidays at Kos (Greece). Amazing! So you might imagine that returning to work is usually less pleasant ;), but that changed when I opened Outlook and saw the email from our systems department that my new developer machine setup was ready.</description>

      <description>JavaScript programming has evolved a lot over the past years and has somehow revolutionized the way you develop on the web. While many initially just used it as a scripting language to quickly hack in some dynamic behavior into traditional websites, it starts now to be used much more like a fully capable programming language (mainly also due to many emerging JavaScript libraries and more capable browsers).</description>

      <description>When &#34;seriously&#34; developing JavaScript applications we obviously need to write tests. Being a fully dynamic language (similar as Ruby), tests are more necessary than ever since there is no compiler that checks for you all the silly mistakes before you run your code the first time.</description>

      <description>Today morning when starting a general build of the project I&#39;m currently working on, I got an error saying &#34;unknown protocol: d&#34;. It was strange since I couldn&#39;t remember of any big changes made and the build didn&#39;t also fail the last time.</description>

      <description>As you may have recognized from the last post I start using Linux more often. With the new upgrade to Gutsy, Ubuntu&#39;s performance is much better (that&#39;s at least my feeling on my notebook) and I really start liking it.</description>

      <description>Well, it is a special kind of color blindness and I&#39;m actually one of those guys affected by it. Recently I thought about posting something about it for sharing my experience with others but a friend of mine - Manfred - was faster :) He wrote a very nice FAQ with a lot of information regarding this topic.</description>

      <description>Why that?? Simply because adding (or better trying to add) a bookmark will result in a total crash of the browser. I mean...ok...it is just a beta release and not really considered for the end-user, but the amount of crashes you experience are even too much for a beta version.</description>
