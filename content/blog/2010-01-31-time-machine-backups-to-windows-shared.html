As some of you may have already read I <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2009/05/my-new-macbook-pro.html">acquired
  a MacBook Pro</a> about half a year ago and I love it ;) . Now one of the really cool things OS X provides is Time
Machine backups.<br /><object height="344" width="425">

great because you simple don't have to do anything. If at all, you can specify the folders which should be excluded
from the backup, but the rest is a completely automated process. Time Machine takes care of creating backups that
contain the best possible coverage, starting from hourly, weekly to monthly backups, depending on the remaining space
on your backup drive.<br /><br />

Apple wouldn't be Apple if they wouldn't have a business model behind this thing.They call it <a href="http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/">Time
  Capsule</a> and it is the device which is intented to be the backup drive on the other side of Time Machine. It is
more than just a simple external (network capable) HD: it may also function as print server and router.<br /><br />Anyway,
I already bought an external HD about 1 1/2 years ago (I guess). Unfortunately it cannot be attached to the network,
but just over USB. So for a while I used to do my backups by manually attaching my HD to the USB port of my MacBook and
let Time Machine do its work. However this is cumbersome and you often forget to attach it regularly and moreover, the
HD usually stands at some place in your&nbsp;apartment. You're not going to take it around and again, it's nerving to
take your notebook there, attach it just for the purpose of doing backups.<br /><br />So the idea came to my mind of
sharing my HD over the network through another computer. I still have my very first notebook, an Acer which is about 6
years old now, I guess. I usually use it as some kind of server, also for sharing my non-network printer to the home
wireless. So why shouldn't I also expose my HD?<br />A <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/95005/any-experiences-using-time-machine-backup-to-windows-network-drive">post

<a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20080420211034137">pages</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.levelofindirection.com/journal/2009/10/10/using-a-networked-drive-for-time-machine-backups-on-a-mac.html">this
  one is another good one</a>). I'm not going to repeat everything since you can get more informations on the linked
pages. The main steps are the following:<br />
<ol>
  <li>Activate 'unsupported' network drives for backup<br />
    <pre class="code">defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1</pre><br /></li>
  <li>Create a sparsebundle which will be used by TimeMachine for doing its job. This sparsebundle has to be created <i>locally</i><br />
    <pre class="code">sudo hdiutil create -size 320g -type SPARSEBUNDLE -nospotlight -volname "Backup of &lt;computer_name&gt;" -fs "Case-sensitive Journaled HFS+" -verbose ~/Desktop/&lt;computer_name&gt;_&lt;mac address&gt;.sparsebundle<br /></pre><br /></li>
  <li>Share the external HD on your Windows server (or notebook as in my case) and make sure you have the necessary
    user rights for writing/reading.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Mount the network drive and copy the created sparsebundle on it<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Configure the network drive for backups by referencing it from within the Time Machine configuration</li>
</ol>
<div>You have to pay attention that the hostname you indicate in the .sparsebundle name matches exactly your Mac's
  hostname. Spaces and strange characters may create problems.<br />Moreover I'd suggest to do the first backup
  directly over a wired network connection since the 1st backup may take quite a while.<br /><br />
  <div class="notebox warn"><b>Note</b>, if you use your ethernet card for doing the initial backup which is highly
    recommended, you have to use the MAC address of your that ethernet card, otherwise Time Machine won't recognize
    your sparsebundle.</div><br />I'm now using this backup mechanism for about three weeks and it
  works&nbsp;seamlessly. When my Mac is within the home wireless network it automatically connects to the shared backup
  drive and starts creating his hourly backups. Just great :)
