Today I started my Visual Studio 2010 instance by using the "Run as administrator" option (as I often do when using the
local IIS server for hosting my webapp). Instead of the VS window I got a nice error message dialog saying<br />
<blockquote>"The application cannot start"</blockquote>The same with VS2008. When starting them normally, everything
worked just fine, but as soon as I tried to run them with admin rights they both failed. They only thing I did today
morning was to to install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c243a5ae-4bd1-4e3d-94b8-5a0f62bf7796">Microsoft
  SQL Server Management Studio Express</a> edition which however (for some unknown reason) failed during install and
performed a rollback. I have the strange sensation this rollback did "roll back" a bit too much things...<br /><a name='more'></a>I
don't know if you remember, but VS2010 beta had a similar issue as I described here<a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2009/10/visual-studio-2010-beta2-cannot-start.html">
  in this post</a>. The solution there was to execute a <code>devenv /resetuserdata</code> operation which is not
really the thing you want. Anyway, I tried it (backing up my settings first obviously)...no change. Still the error
popped up.<br /><br />In <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2009/10/29/how-to-fix-the-application-cannot-start-error.aspx">2009
  a post on the Visual Studio blog</a> described this same issue that was present in the beta 2 version suggesting the
reset of the user data. The solution to fix the problem however was a comment given by Øyvind Gellein. Adapting it to
my x64 system, one has to execute the following:<br />
<pre class="brush:bash">C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\MSEnv&gt; regsvr32 DTE100.OLB<br />C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\MSEnv&gt; regsvr32 DTE80.OLB<br />C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\MSEnv&gt; regsvr32 DTE80a.OLB<br />C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\MSEnv&gt; regsvr32 DTE90a.OLB<br />C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\MSEnv&gt; regsvr32 DTE90.OLB</pre>
