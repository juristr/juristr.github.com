Extenders are a really cool feature of C#, which can be quite handy sometimes. I found the following extender I've
written the most useful. Think for instance how often you have to write conditions like<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">if(someObject.stringPropertyX.Equals("abc") || someObject.stringPropertyX.Equals("def") || ....){<br />    //do something<br />    ...<br />}else{<br />   //do something other...<br />   ....<br />}<br /></pre>This
concatenated or's or also ands may be quite messy to look at and also to change. And in addition it's not very
comfortable to write since you repeatedly have to write the object.property etc...(or copy&amp;paste it). Packing all
of this inside an extender method for the string object (this is just a special case, you could do that of course also
for other kind of objects) makes everything much cleaner:<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">using System;<br />using System.Collections.Generic;<br />using System.Linq;<br />using System.Text;<br /><br />namespace Some.Namespace.Extenders<br />{<br />    public static class StringExtender<br />    {<br />        /// &lt;summary&gt;<br />        /// Evaluates whether the String is contained in AT LEAST one of the passed values (i.e. similar to the "in" SQL clause)<br />        /// &lt;/summary&gt;<br />        /// &lt;param name="thisString"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br />        /// &lt;param name="values"&gt;list of strings used for comparison&lt;/param&gt;<br />        /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;c&gt;true&lt;/c&gt; if the string is contained in AT LEAST one of the passed values&lt;/returns&gt;<br />        public static bool In(this String thisString, params string[] values)<br />        {<br />            foreach (string val in values)<br />            {<br />                if (thisString.Equals(val, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))<br />                    return true;<br />            }<br /><br />            return false; //no occurence found<br />        }<br />    }<br />}<br /></pre>So
using the extender with the dummy example above would result in the following code<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">if(someObject.stringPropertyX.In("abc", "def",...,"xyz"){<br />   //do something<br />   ...<br />}else{<br />  //do something other...<br />  ....<br />}<br /></pre>Doesn't
this look much nicer?? I find it much more readable. It abstracts and hides all of the logical operators and property
calls. By looking at the code you immediately see the important facts without being distracted. You're also much
quicker in adding (in this case) new strings for comparison in contrast to the case before where you have to make sure
to copy (write) the object + parameter invocation, add the logical connector properly etc... You could easily do the
same with the AND logical operator and also for the corresponding negations (I just didn't work out the details).<br /><br />A
thing which I don't really like about the extenders is the fact that you have to explicitly define the extender class's
namespace in the new class where you want to use the extended methods. Otherwise you won't see your extended methods.
This is kind of stupid because the other developers in the team won't recognize the method until you tell them
explicitly to use it (which anyway is the best way to ensure it).<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Related
