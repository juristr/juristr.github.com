Last year I wrote an in depth article on how to conditionally style Angular components:

{{<article-link
    url="/blog/2016/01/learning-ng2-dynamic-styles/"
    title="Learning Angular: Conditionally add styles to an element"
    text="Learn how to conditionally add styles to a DOM element in Angular"

>}}

The article walks through different kind of possibilities Angular offers and helps decide which approach might be the best for your current scenario or use case.
