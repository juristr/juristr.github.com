Packt Publishing recently approached me about quickly reviewing a video series on [JBoss EAP and its configuration, deployment and administration][Packt-video-link]. Although I'm primarily working with the .Net stack, I've developed quite some stuff in Java as well in the past and so I was curious to again give it a look, also because I didn't work with JBoss so far.

Packt's video tutorials are quite interesting as they are split into small chapters guiding you through the different sections of the tutorial. Videos are obviously available in HD (or lower if needed) and can either be directly streamed from their website or downloaded for offline viewing.

The JBoss EAP administration video is split in the following sections:

1. Standalone vs domain mode
2. Adding and configuring databases, message queues and using them from your application
3. Configuring the JVM for troubleshooting and diagnostics
4. Clustering and load balancing for web applications
5. Classloading using JBoss Modules
6. Deploying applications
7. Building and testing applications with Maven and JBoss tools

Each of these chapters contains subchapters with a series of ~6min videos. I only watched those that seemed particularly interesting as I didn't manage to watch all of them (yet). Each topic is clearly explained and really easy to follow (even by non-domain experts like myself). Source code (such as config files or example applications) is included as well.  
So if you're an admin or devop that needs to configure and administer a JBoss application server and you still have some doubts about some of the topics mentioned above, then this video series might definitely be worth looking at.

If you're interested, you can find them here: [JBoss EAP Configuration, Deployment, and Administration][Packt-video-link]
