For preserving the search&nbsp;criteria on some page of our web application we're saving the different settings of the
search filters into a cookie. So, when the user comes back next time we can restore the search filter settings that
have been used previously.<br />Now however one of my working&nbsp;colleagues had the problem that some strings where
not correctly retrieved from the cookie. Actually it was a character encoding problem. Characters like "ü,ö,.." were
not displayed correctly after retrieving them from the cookie. I'm not sure whether you can set the character encoding
of cookies. I don't think so, I've however not done any deep search on the web. Our solution was to do an
url-encoding/decoding on the "critical" values of the cookie. So you can do something like<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">public void SaveValuesToCookie(){<br />   ...<br />   Response.Cookies["key1"]["valuekey"] = Server.UrlEncode(criticalValue);<br />   ...<br />}<br /><br />public void LoadValuesFromCookie(){<br />   ...<br />   retrievedValue = Server.UrlDecode(Request.Cookies["key1"]["valuekey"]);<br />   ...<br />}<br /></pre>
