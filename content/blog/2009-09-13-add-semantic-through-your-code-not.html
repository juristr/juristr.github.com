Is it good to have a lot of code comments, explaining things s.t. your other team members know what was your intention
when writing certain pieces?? Well, not fully. Having a lot of code comments throughout your code is also considered to
be a code smell and should therefore be avoided. But so, what should be done? Just remove the comments? No, the key
part is to add semantic by writing explicit, well readable code.<br /><br />One way (of many such as writing meaningful
variable names) of adding semantic to your code is in my eyes tightly related to the <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html">"Extract
  Method"</a> refactoring. I'd like to mention it here shortly with a real example because I think people should care
about this and apply it (where appropriate of course).<br /><br />The method below shows a "real" code sample, where a
comment has been added for explaining the purpose of the following lines of code.<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">if (someConditionHolds)<br />{<br />    <b>//formats the date according to the given culture</b><br />    DateTime date;<br />    if (DateTime.TryParse(textBoxDate.Text, new CultureInfo(this.PreviousCulture), DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal, out date))<br />    {<br />        textBoxDate.Text = date.ToString(this.DisplayFormat, Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture);<br />    }<br />}</pre>This
code looks quite complex, you see the reading of the culture from the current thread, then there is some other code
involved which is creating a new culture object based on the previously used culture etc...Basically a lot of complex
stuff which I don't want to bother about if I was not the developer who wrote this piece. So one would read the comment
above and understand, ok, these lines are just formatting the date according to the current culture and assigning it to
the textbox.<br /><br />In such a case Fowler suggests to apply the "<a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html">Extract
  Method</a>" refactoring and restructure it as follows<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">if (someConditionHolds)<br />{<br />    textBoxDate.Text = GetCultureFormattedDateString(textBoxDate.Text);<br />}</pre><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">private string GetCultureFormattedDateString(string toFormat)<br />{<br />    string result = toFormat;<br /><br />    DateTime date;<br />    if (DateTime.TryParse(textBoxDate.Text, new CultureInfo(this.PreviousCulture), DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal, out date))<br />    {<br />        result = date.ToString(this.DisplayFormat, Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture);<br />    }<br /><br />    return result;<br />}</pre>Now
this really looks simple, doesn't it? When I read over the code, I come across the method call and I immediately catch
what is going on by reading the method name. Then, if I'm interested in this special thing, I can go and read the
complex implementation, but otherwise I just don't care and go on.
