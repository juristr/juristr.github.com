## Nx Website, Sourcecode and Documentation

- **[Nrwl Website](https://nrwl.io) -** Nrwl is the company behind the open source tool Nx

## Repo README: Instructions, talks, podcasts,...

The Nx GitHub repo's [README.md](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) has a ton of useful and up-to-date info on how to best get started, including talks, podcasts and blog posts.

## Video Courses

If you like watching videos rather than reading through articles and the docs, here are some options:

- **[Scale React Development with Nx](https://egghead.io/playlists/scale-react-development-with-nx-4038) -** completely free course with over 1h 30min of content. It focuses on React, but since Nx is a tech agnostic CLI, most of the shown commands can be easily translated to Angular as well.
- **[Nx Playbook](https://nxplaybook.com/) -** the Nx Playbook site is Nrwls channel for official Nx videos. It comes with some free intro course as well as a paid more advanced Nx course
- **[Nrwls Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF8luR7ORJTCwSNA9yZksCw) -** Nrwls official Youtube channel where the team regularly shares tutorial videos about Nx as well as the recordings of the regular office hours

## Community

There are various possibilities:

- [Nrwl Community Slack](https://bit.ly/2ZApcSo)
- [Angular Discord](http://discord.gg/angular) which has a dedicated Nx channel

## How to best learn

Go through some of the docs and videos to get the general idea, but then jump straight into actually trying it out and playing around with some of the concepts.
