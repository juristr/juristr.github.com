Well, I'd say it depends. If you use regions to logically group your code in your class, then it may be a good thing
'cause people come to your class and see something like<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">public class MyDummyClass : IMySuperInterface<br />{<br />   public MyDummyClass(...)<br />   {<br />      ...<br />   } <br /><br />   #region Properties<br />   ...<br />   #endregion<br /><br />   #region Utility<br />   ...<br />   #endregion<br /><br />   #region Implementation of IMySuperInterface<br />   ...<br />   #endregion<br />}</pre>In
such case it may increase the organization of the code inside your class. I wouldn't say it increases the readability
of your class since it's just a matter of code reorganization.<br /><br />Many times however you find people using
regions like<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">public class MyBLClass : IMySuperInterface<br />{<br />   public MyBLClass(...)<br />   {<br />      ...<br />   } <br /><br />   public IList<sometype> ReadAllOrComputeWhatever(...)<br />   {<br />      if(parameterA &gt;= someNumberOrString)<br />      {<br />         #region Check for blablabal<br />            // 30LOC+ hidden here of CC 10+<br />         #endregion<br />         ...<br />      }<br />   }<br />}</sometype></pre>...then
regions suddenly aren't that nice any more. I find that a lot of people actually use it for hiding their ugly,
"smelling" pieces of code which would highly have the need of being refactored. I think this is very much related<a

<ul>
  <li><u>logically grouping:</u> good thing, though it depends on preferences (I personally don't like it that much)</li>
  <li><u>code hiding:</u> bad practice. Sign of a code smell and you should consider to<a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2009/09/add-semantic-through-your-code-not.html">
      refactor it</a>.<br /></li>
</ul>
