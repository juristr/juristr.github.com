<p>A couple of days ago I was kindly invited to the <a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/p/jcg.html">Java Code Geeks</a> program. Their goal is to build an online community for Java developers by aggregating and republishing content from different bloggers on their blog.<br /><blockquote>The JCG program builds mutually beneficial partnerships between Java Code Geeks and community bloggers whose articles are of interest to the Java developer community. The program simplifies the process of publishing selected blog articles by JCG members onto Java Code Geeks site. &nbsp;Through this process, our JCGs enjoy substantially increased visibility and our audience enjoys great content.</blockquote></p>

The posts here on this blog are quite diversified in their content, mostly depending on my current involvement in projects. At the moment I'm still quite busy with my MSc thesis which I'll present in two weeks. So, cross your fingers ;).&nbsp;After my graduation I will hopefully find some time to finish some of my planned projects. From that there might emerge some interesting posts.<br /><br />So keep an eye on this blog here and on Java Code Geeks as well ;).
