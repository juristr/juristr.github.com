## It's not about the tool, it's about the habit!

The search for the “right” tool often feels to me like the search for the Holy Grail. I’ve used several over the years (I even used a self-built one for storing and finding frequent code snippets before Gists were a thing). [Trello](https://trello.com) did an awesome job for many years. I had an overall tasks/goals board where I added thins to a backlog, prioritized them and moved them into a weekly board as they were ready to go. As a good engineer :D I even automated most of the stuff with [Trello Butler](https://help.trello.com/article/1198-an-intro-to-butler) rules.



I’ve tried different tools over time. The main reason was to 

...but tools can help sometimes

## What tool => digital vs analog (e.g. paper notebook)

A difficult choice


## BestSelf - Getting a Structure

- structuring your thoughts
- defining goals

## Paper Notebook for daily reflection

- it's about the process of writing things down (you already know)
- take time, sit down, reflect, write it down
- pleasant to go over past notes as well

## Using Notion

- current setup
- less automation (error of too much automated..get lost in configuring stuff)
- power of having it everywhere
- link information

### Goal planning

- objectives
- key results => mathematical calculation of achieving something => make it measurable (what you cannot measure, you cannot control)
- progress visualization

### No Backlog

- backlogs create peace initially because you know you’ve noted that important thing you want to do somewhere...but then create anxiety when you come back and see how much stuff you were not able to do and probably will never be
- something comes up -> match against Goals for the current cycle
- if it matches, add to the key results page in Notion as a reminder
