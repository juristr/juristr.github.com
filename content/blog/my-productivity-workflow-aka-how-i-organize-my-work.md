## It's not about the tool, it's about the habit!

...but tools can help sometimes

What tool => digital vs analog (e.g. paper notebook)

## BestSelf - Getting a Structure

- structuring your thoughts
- defining goals

## Paper Notebook for daily reflection

- it's about the process of writing things down (you already know)
- take time, sit down, reflect, write it down
- pleasant to go over past notes as well

## Using Notion

- current setup
- less automation (error of too much automated..get lost in configuring stuff)
- power of having it everywhere
- link information

### Current setup

- objectives
- key results => mathematical calculation of achieving something => make it measurable (what you cannot measure, you cannot control)
- progress visualization
