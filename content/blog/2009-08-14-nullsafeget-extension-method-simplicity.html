When programming, there is often the the situation where you have to continuously do the null-check in order to not get
exceptions. For instance take the dummy example of a Person object with an according Address object. Like this...<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">class Person<br />{<br />    public string Name { get; set; }<br />    public Address Address { get; set; }<br />}<br /><br />class Address<br />{<br />    public string Street { get; set; }<br /><br />    public string GetCountry()<br />    {<br />        return "Italy"; //just dummy code<br />    }<br />}<br /></pre>Now
consider the case where you'd like to access the Street property of the Address object<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">//some code, person is an instance of Person<br />textBoxStreet.Text = person.Address.Street;<br /></pre>I
guess everyone agrees that this will give a nice NullReferenceException if the Address object is null. This results in
continuously (now this is just a dummy example) checking for null<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">...<br />if(person.Address != null)<br />  textBoxStreet.Text = person.Address.Street;<br /></pre>In
this example it even looks simple enough, but in certain conditions it may be quite awkward. I actually found the
approach on a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1196031/evil-use-of-maybe-monad-and-extension-methods-in-c">Stackoverflow
  post</a> which pointed to <a href="http://code.logos.com/blog/2008/01/nullpropagating_extension_meth.html">this blog
  here</a>. A solution is to use extension methods which - apparently - can also be applied to a null instance of an
object.<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">public static class NullSafeGetExtension<br />{<br /><br />    public static U NullsafeGet&lt;T, U&gt;(this T t, Func&lt;T, U&gt; fn)<br />    {<br />        if (t != null)<br />            return fn(t);<br />        else<br />            return default(U);<br />    }<br /><br />}<br /></pre>I
called it "NullsafeGet", another commonly used name is "IfNotNull"...it's just a matter of preferences. This solution
allows to write the above code like<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">//some code, person is an instance of Person<br />textBoxStreet.Text = person.NullsafeGet(x =&gt; x.Address).NullsafeGet(x =&gt; x.Street);<br /></pre>This
turns out to be a quite nice solution since you don't need all of the nested ifs. In this example it was obviously
simple enough to write the if instead of using the extension methods. This piece from the Stackoverflow post probably
illustrates the advantage in a more clear way:<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">string activeControlName = null;<br />var activeForm = Form.ActiveForm;<br />if (activeForm != null)<br />{<br />    var activeControl = activeForm.ActiveControl;<br />    if(activeControl != null)<br />    {<br />        activeControlname = activeControl.Name;<br />    }<br />}<br /></pre>And
with the extension method solution...<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">activeControlname = activeForm.NullsafeGet(x =&gt; x.ActiveControl).NullsafeGet(x =&gt; x.Name);<br /></pre>Although
this looks quite nicely, my doubt is on the readability of the code itself....So I don't know whether I'll really use
it...<br />What do you think??
