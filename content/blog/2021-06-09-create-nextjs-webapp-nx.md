## Next.js meets Nx

In order to create a new Next.js application, we have two options mainly:

- use the [Next.js CLI](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- use a [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev/latest/react/guides/nextjs)

We're going to use Nx for this setup because it provides a series of advantages:

- support for multiple apps (we can easily add more apps to our workspace and share common logic)
- structure our code as [workspace libraries](https://nx.dev/latest/react/structure/creating-libraries), thus facilitating a cleaner architecture, code reuse and responsibility segregation
- improved build and test speed via Nx [affected commands](https://nx.dev/latest/react/core-concepts/affected) and [computation caching](https://nx.dev/latest/react/core-concepts/computation-caching)
- out of the box support for code generation, [Storybook](https://nx.dev/latest/react/storybook/overview) and [Cypress integration](https://nx.dev/latest/react/cypress/overview)

These parts will be covered in more detail in the upcoming articles that are part of this series.

To create a new Nx workspace, use the following command.

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace juridev --packageManager=yarn
```

`juridev` here is the name of my organization and will be your namespace when you import libraries which we'll see later.

When asked, use Next.js as the preset

{{<figure url="/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/create-nx-workspace.png" size="full">}}

During the setup, you'll be asked to give the generated application a name. I use "site" for now as this is going to be my main Next.js website. Make sure to **choose CSS as the styling framework**. Because we’ll be using Tailwind later, we need pure CSS and PostCSS processing.

Once the installation and setup completes, run `yarn start` (or `npm start`) to launch the Next.js dev server and navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). You should see the running application.

## Nx Workspace structure

Let's quickly explore the Nx workspace structure to learn some of the fundamentals.

### Apps and Libs

An Nx workspace is structured into **apps** and **libs**. Instead of having all the different features of our app just within folders of our application folder, we rather split them up into “workspace libraries”. Most of our business and domain logic should reside in those libraries. The apps can be seen as our “deployables”. They import the functionality in the libs as the building blocks to create a deployable app.

Although the libraries can be built and published (see [Publishable and Buildable Libraries](https://nx.dev/latest/react/structure/buildable-and-publishable-libraries/)), they don’t have to. They are referenced via TypeScript path mappings in the `tsconfig.base.json` configuration at the root of the Nx workspace. When we build the application, all referenced libraries are built into the app via the used bundler (e.g. Webpack or Rollup etc). 

### Config files: workspace.json and nx.json

Let’s give a fast overview of the main configuration files. All the details can be found on the official docs page: [https://nx.dev/latest/react/core-concepts/configuration](https://nx.dev/latest/react/core-concepts/configuration)

The `workspace.json` is the main configuration file of an Nx workspace. It defines

- the projects in the workspace (e.g. apps and libs)
- the [Nx executor](https://nx.dev/latest/react/executors/using-builders) used to run operations on the projects (e.g. serve the app, build it, run Jest tests, Storybook etc..)

The `nx.json` defines mostly additional configuration properties used for the [Nx dependency graph](https://nx.dev/latest/react/structure/dependency-graph). Additionally, you can define the base branch (e.g. `master` or `main` or whatever you are using) and the [task runner](https://nx.dev/latest/react/core-concepts/configuration#tasks-runner-options) to be used.

### Serving, building and testing

The Nx workspace.json config defines what you can actually serve, build, test etc. Here’s a quick example of such a configuration for a project called `cart`.

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "cart": {
      "root": "apps/cart",
      "sourceRoot": "apps/cart/src",
      "projectType": "application",
      "targets": {
        "build": {
          "executor": "@nrwl/web:build",
          "options": {
            "outputPath": "dist/apps/cart",
            ...
          },
          ...
        },
        "serve": {...},
        "test": {
          "executor": "@nrwl/jest:jest",
          "options": {
            ...
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It defines targets for `build`, `serve` and `test`. These can be invoked using the following syntax:

```bash
npx nx run <proj-name>:<target> <options>
```

> Note, we use `npx` in front because we don't have Nx installed globally. Thus npx will fallback and execute the installed binary in our node_modules folder. You can obviously also install Nx globally and get rid of having to prefix commands with `npx`


So to serve our app we run `nx run cart:serve`, to build it `nx run cart:build` and so on. There are also shortcuts, meaning we can alternatively invoke these commands like `nx serve cart` or `nx build cart`.

> In Nx "targets" are invocable commands. There are predefined commands such as build, serve, test that get set up when you generate a new application. You can also define your custom ones, either by building your own [Nx Executor](https://nx.dev/latest/react/executors/using-builders) or use the [Nx Run-Commands](https://nx.dev/latest/react/workspace/run-commands-executor).

## Working on our Next App

### Understanding Page Structures: Generating the About Page

When looking at the setup you'll see a "pages" folder. Every file returning a React component in there, instructs Next.js to generate a new page. As you can see there is an `index.tsx` page, which you see when navigating to the root of the Next website `http://localhost:4200`. To better understand this, let's create an About page that responds at `http://localhost:4200/about`.

Nx has some nice generators for that already. Hence, typing..

```bash
npx nx generate @nrwl/next:page --name=about --style=css
```

..generates a new `about.tsx` (with its according styling file).

```tsx
import './about.module.scss';

/* eslint-disable-next-line */
export interface AboutProps {}

export function About(props: AboutProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to about!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default About;
```

> Btw, if you're not the terminal kind of person, you can also use the [Nx Console VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console) plugin.

If we now serve our app with `npx nx serve site` and navigate to `/about`, we should see something like the following:

{{<figure url="/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/next-webapp-running.png" size="full">}}

### Understanding `getStaticProps`

[Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation)

`getStaticProps` allow us to return props to our React component that's going to be pre-rendered by Next.js. It gets the `context` object as a parameter and should return an object of the form.

```tsx
return {
  props: { /* your own properties */ }
}
```

We can write our `getStaticProps` as follows:

```tsx
// apps/site/pages/about.tsx
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next';
...

export interface AboutProps {
  name: string;
}
...

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<AboutProps> = async (context) => {
  return {
    props: {
      name: 'Juri'
    },
  };
};
```

Note how we use TypeScript to type the return value of our function to match our `AboutProps` from the `about.tsx` component. You can find more info about how to use the `getStaticProps` and others [with TypeScript on the official Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#typescript-use-getstaticprops).

We can now use the props in our React component:

```tsx
export function About(props: AboutProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {props.name}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<AboutProps> = async (context) => {
  ...
}
```

{{<figure url="/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/getstaticprops-page.png" size="full">}}

### Understanding `getStaticPaths`

[Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation)

If we want to create a blog, we'll want to load pages dynamically. So we cannot really give them a static name as we did with our About page (`about.tsx`).

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/next:page --name=[slug] --style=none --directory=articles
```

This generates a new `articles` folder with a new `[slug].tsx` file. The `[slug]` part is where Next.js understands it is dynamic and needs to be filled accordingly. Let's also clean up the generated part a bit, changing the React component name to `Article` as well as the corresponding TS interface.

So first of all let's focus on the `getStaticPaths` function which we define as follows:

```tsx
// apps/site/pages/articles/[slug].tsx
import { ParsedUrlQuery } from 'querystring';

interface ArticleProps extends ParsedUrlQuery {
  slug: string;
}

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths<ArticleProps> = async () => {
  ...
}
```

[According to the docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) the function needs to return an object, having a `paths` as well as `fallback` property:

```tsx
return {
  paths: [
    { params: { ... } }
  ],
  fallback: true or false
};
```

The `paths` section contains the number of pages that should be pre-rendered. So we could have something like

```tsx
return {
  paths: [
    {
      slug: 'page1'
    },
    {
      slug: 'page2'
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

From a mental model, this would instruct Next.js to "generate" (obviously it doesn't) at the place of our `[slug].tsx` a `page1.tsx` and `page2.tsx` which are then converted to pages accessible at `/articles/page1` and `/articles/page2`.

This would be the place where you would go and read your file system or query the API for all the pages you wanna render. But more about that later. To simplify things, let us just generate a set of "pages":

```tsx
export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths<ArticleProps> = async () => {
  return {
    paths: [1, 2, 3].map((idx) => {
      return {
        params: {
          slug: `page${idx}`,
        },
      };
    }),
    fallback: false,
  };
};
```

The returned `params` object can be accessed from within the `getStaticProps` which we've seen before and potentially remapped to something else. Here's the place where you could further elaborate the content, say we get the content in markdown, we could process and convert it to HTML here. 

In this simple scenario we just pass it along:

```tsx
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<ArticleProps> = async ({
  params,
}: {
  params: ArticleProps;
}) => {
  return {
    props: {
      slug: params.slug,
    },
  };
};
```

And finally we can access it from within the page React component:

```tsx
export function Article(props: ArticleProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Visiting {props.slug}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

{{<figure url="/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/getstaticpaths-page.png" size="full">}}

### What about `fallback`?

There's another property returned by the `getStaticPaths` function: `fallback`. The Next.js docs are pretty clear about it, so make sure to [check them out](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#the-fallback-key-required). 

In short, `fallback: false` renders only the set of pages returned by the `paths` property. If a given page doesn't find a match, a 404 page (that comes with Next.js) is being rendered.

> It’s also useful when the new pages are not added often. If you add more items to the data source and need to render the new pages, you’d need to run the build again.

If `fallback: true` the difference is that pages that have not been rendered during build time (e.g. that are not in the `paths` property) will not result in a 404 page. Rather, Next.js returns a [Fallback page](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fallback-pages) (e.g. a page where you could display a loading indicator) and then statically generates the page and the corresponding HTML and sends it back to the client, where the fallback page is swapped with the real one. Furthermore, it will be added to the sets of pre-rendered pages, s.t. any subsequent call will be immediate.

## Building and Exporting our Next.js application with Nx

Next.js defines two main options when it comes to generating your deployable: 

- **build -** allows to generate an optimized bundle that can be served by the `next` CLI, e.g. when deploying to some [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) infrastructure. It requires a Node environment that can run the application. We will talk more about deployment of Next.js apps in an upcoming article
- **export -** allows to generate a static site out of your Next.js application. This is ideal if you don't have a Node environment and you just want to serve the app from some static CDN.

Hence, also the Nx configuration (in `workspace.json`) has matching Nx targets (see the section about "Nx Workspace structure" to learn more). 

We can invoke the "build" with 

```
nx run site:build --configuration=production
```

or alternatively with `nx build site`.

Similarly, the `export` can be invoked with

```
nx run site:export --configuration=production
```

or `nx export site`. Using the `export` command will automatically build the Next.js app first.

By passing `--configuration=production` (or `--prod`) the production configuration is being used which is defined in the `workspace.json` and which can set additional production environment only properties:

```json
"build": {
    "executor": "@nrwl/next:build",
    "outputs": ["{options.outputPath}"],
    "options": {
        "root": "apps/site",
        "outputPath": "dist/apps/site"
    },
    "configurations": {
        "production": {}
    }
},
```

## Conclusion

So here's what we learned:

- How to generate a Next.js project with Nx
- About the Nx workspace anatomy
- How to generate new pages such as our site's about page
- How to generate pages dynamically based on some slug and what role `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` play with that. This part will be particularly useful to generate our blog post articles
