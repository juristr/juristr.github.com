According to a note on the official <a href="http://googlemashupeditor.blogspot.com/2009/01/from-mashup-editor-to-app-engine.html">Google
  Mashup Blog</a>, they're about to shut down the <a href="http://editor.googlemashups.com/">Google Mashup Editor</a>
product. They took the valuable info they got from a numerous of Mashup developers to develop their AppEngine which
will somehow replace the Mashup editor, although it is a different, much more complex product (with more features of
course).<br /><br />It's a pity to see it go, also because I had some projects hosted there and moreover it was quite
useful for developing and hosting<a href="http://www.google.com/ig/adde?moduleurl=techblogsearch.googlemashups.com/gadget.xml">
  iGoogle gadgets</a>:<br />
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://newsmapper.googlemashups.com/">News Mapper</a><br />Quite interesting product which got even
    mentioned on <a href="http://googlemashupeditor.blogspot.com/2007/10/nice-work.html">the official Google blog</a>
    and appeared under the popular mashups of the <a href="http://www.gmashups.com/">unofficial Google Mashup gallery
      blog</a>.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><a href="http://apotheken-suedtirol.googlemashups.com/">Pharmacy Locator</a><br />Still not finished. The data
    has been added manually but I planned to retrieve it in an automated fashion from some source. I guess this could
    have become quite interesting.</li>
</ul>&nbsp;Too bad...<br /><br />Btw, <a href="http://pages.google.com/">Google Page Creator</a> is also being shut
down during June and July. Everything will be moved to <a href="http://sites.google.com/">Google Sites</a> which is
much more advanced (<a href="http://projects.js-development.com/">my project site</a> is hosted there). Most bloggers
(myself included) however host their external files on Page creator such as CSS, javascript and images. Although your
Google Page will be automatically moved to Google Sites, your external files won't be moved. So be aware that you have
to host them on some other provider (<a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2009/05/dropbox-sharing-synching-and-backup-has.html">Dropbox</a>
may be an option).
