First of all, who is "Joel"? Joel Spolsky is a software developer in the US. I came across <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">his
  interesting blog</a> about a year ago. He started his working career at Microsoft and left it in 2000, founding
(together with Michael Pryor) his own company: <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek Software</a> (take a look
at the pictures there...this is what I call a nice working environment :) ).<br />One of my favourite quotes from him:<br />
<blockquote>[...]We didn't start with a particular product in mind: our goal was simply to build the kind of software
  company where we would want to work, one in which programmers and software developers are the stars and everything
  else serves only to make them productive and happy.[...]</blockquote>He is the one of the creators of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow.com</a>
which in my opinion is one of the best developer sites available on the net. The idea of letting developers vote is
amazing since in this way the system corrects and balances itself (the same concept as behind Wikipedia). People just
writing bad stuff will just get voted down or even removed. The next site <a href="http://serverfault.com/">Serverfault.com</a>
is also in beta which is most for system admins.<br /><br />But let's return to the topic. What is the "Joel Test"?<br />
<blockquote>[...]It's a fairly esoteric system for measuring how good a software team is.[...]&nbsp; The great part
  about it is that it takes about 3 minutes.[...]</blockquote><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Here</a>
