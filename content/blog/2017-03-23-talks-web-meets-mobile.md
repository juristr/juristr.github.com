## Automatic Progressive Web Apps using the Angular Mobile Toolkit by Maxim Salnikov 

[Maxim Salnikov](https://twitter.com/webmaxru) is an absolute community supporter, have hardly seen someone that's more dedicated to help people. That can be easily seen from the amount of conferences and meetup groups he's organizing. He's the founder of [@ngVikingsConf](https://twitter.com/ngVikingsConf), [@mobileeraconf](https://twitter.com/mobileeraconf). He also organizes [@MobileOslo](https://twitter.com/mobileoslo) and [@AngularOslo](https://twitter.com/angularoslo) as well as co-organizes [@framsia](https://twitter.com/framsia) & [@mobile_pulse](https://twitter.com/mobile_pulse). He's also a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies.

And even though Maxim had his birthday at 21st of March (the day we had our meetup), he was willing to give us a talk and share his knowledge with us. Happy birthday Maxim!! :birthday:

## Overview of NativeScript - Build native iOS/Android apps with Angular 

I first got to know Nathan when he offered to [review my video course on "Learning Angular Components"](https://goo.gl/zrGX8K). An absolute amazing guy. [Nathan Walker](https://twitter.com/wwwalkerrun) is a Telerik Developer Expert for NativeScript and active Angular community contributor, known for his amazing NativeScript libraries, contributions to angular-seed as well as for being the author of angular-seed-advanced. He's also an Egghead author and published a series of courses:

Unfortunately we had some connectivity issues during our live-broadcast with Nathan. But he was so kind to re-record his talk with super-crisp audio and give us the permission to share it with all of you :heart_eyes:. Watch this super insightful talk into the power of NativeScript.
