Microsoft's .Net AjaxControlToolkit provides a nice extender for doing Ajax-enabled auto-completion by calling a
webservice on the server-side.<br />Below is a sample:<br />
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;cc1:AutoCompleteExtender2 ID="aceBirthPlace" runat="server" SecondControlElementID="txbBirthPlaceCode"<br />TargetControlID="txbBirthPlace" ServicePath="~/FormsControls/AutoCompleteLists.asmx"<br />ServiceMethod="GetAllMunicipality" MinimumPrefixLength="3" <b>CompletionInterval="100"</b><br />EnableCaching="true" CompletionSetCount="20" FirstRowSelected="true"&gt;<br />&lt;/cc1:AutoCompleteExtender2&gt;</pre>Today
however I recognized a problem with the <span class="code">CompletionInterval</span> property.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">CompletionInterval:</span> Time in milliseconds when the timer will kick
  in to get suggestions using the web service.</blockquote>Since we got some complaints that the appearance of the
autocomplete box takes to long, we set the <span class="code">CompletionInterval</span> to "0" (zero). In that way,
once the <span class="code">MinimumPrefixLength</span> is reached the javascript starts to call the webservice.
Everything worked fine with Firefox but - as usual - on IE no autocomplete entry was shown at all. Changing the value
to "100" made everything work again. I don't know the exact reason (don't have the time to check it out).
