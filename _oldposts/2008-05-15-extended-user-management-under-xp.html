This will become just a very short post since I'm too tired to write a lot today. I just set up my little "server" the term is maybe not really appropriate, anyway. What I'm doing is to use my old notebook as some kind of server, where I can store common files, and on which I'm performing bigger downloads. I just wanted to configure the machine s.t. it always logs on automatically with the same account. This is quite comfortable when you control it remotely and you have to perform a restart or something. The system installed on my old notebook is a Windows XP Home Edition - not really great, but it works. Well...to come back, I wanted to set up this user-account configuration, but the Windows Home standard of managing and configuring user accounts is quite limiting, especially if you're accustomed to the one used on Win2k.<br />To come to an end, if you want to have also that same extended user management on your Windows XP machine, just start the following script, which puts a key in the registry:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" ><a href="http://strumpflohner.blog.googlepages.com/extendedusermanagement.reg">Download Windows registry script</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:130%;">The content is the following:</span><br /><pre class="code"><br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br /><br />[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{98641F47-8C25-4936-BEE4-C2Ce1298969D}]<br />@="XP extended user management"<br />"InfoTip"="Extended user managing for XP"<br /><br />[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{98641F47-8C25-4936-BEE4-C2Ce1298969D}\DefaultIcon]<br />@="%SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\Shell32.dll,111"<br /><br />[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{98641F47-8C25-4936-BEE4-C2Ce1298969D}\Shell]<br /><br />[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{98641F47-8C25-4936-BEE4-C2Ce1298969D}\Shell\Open]<br /><br />[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{98641F47-8C25-4936-BEE4-C2Ce1298969D}\Shell\Open\command]<br />@="Control Userpasswords2"<br /><br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ControlPanel\NameSpace\{98641F47-8C25-4936-BEE4-C2Ce1298969D}]<br />@="Userpasswords2 in Systemsteuerung aktivieren"<br /></pre><br />After you double-click on the script, it will be executed. As a consequence you'll find an entry in your control panel which looks as follows:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SCyTMYCukmI/AAAAAAAABI0/Snfg-vljD_8/s1600-h/extUserManagXP.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SCyTMYCukmI/AAAAAAAABI0/Snfg-vljD_8/s400/extUserManagXP.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5200693510527685218" border="0" /></a>I hope I was able to help some of you :)
