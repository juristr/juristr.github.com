Once again one of my blog posts got infected by "spam" comments. But this time not the usual pharmaceutical spam messages which you immediately recognize.<br /><blockquote>I recently came accross your blog and have been reading along. I thought I would leave my first comment. I dont know what to say except that I have enjoyed reading. Nice blog. I will keep visiting this blog very often.<br /><br /><i>[LINK DROPPED]</i></blockquote>So if you see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22I+recently+came+accross+your+blog+and+have+been+reading+along.+I+thought+I+would+leave+my+first+comment.+I+dont+know+what+to+say+except+that+I+have+enjoyed+reading.+Nice+blog.+I+will+keep+visiting+this+blog+very+often.%22">such messages</a> drop them immediately, because the only goal of these spammers is to "eat from page-rank-cake" by placing their own links at the end of their comments. It's really awkward because I don't want to restrict people from commenting on my blog, neither by enforcing them to own a Google Account, nor by implying "comment moderation". But I fear that if it continues this way I'll have to react somehow (sorry for that).<br />What I wonder is how these spammers are able to leave their comments because when commenting you have to enter these word verifications. Poor guys if they do it manually. They should better produce <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2009/03/guidelines-for-promoting-your-blog.html">good content</a> rather than trying to get a high page-rank this way.<br /><br />This was the guy that left the spam comments: g$o$o$g$l$e$t$e$l$e$c$o$m$m$u$t$e$DOT$blogspot$DOT$com<br />(I made the URL a bit unreadable to not make advertisement and give him what he wanted....so..keep him on your black list ;) )
