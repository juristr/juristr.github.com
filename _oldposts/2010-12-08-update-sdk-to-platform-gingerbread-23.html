Today I took the chance (and a bit of free time) to upgrade to the latest Android SDK release, namely Gingerbread. Experience has shown that you better back up your Eclipse as well as currently <br />installed Android SDK folder, especially if you're working on an important project (which I consider my Master thesis project to be kind of ;)).<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://developer.android.com/assets/images/home/gingerdroid.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://developer.android.com/assets/images/home/gingerdroid.png" /></a></div><br />After upgrading, performing the mandatory "Eclipse &gt; Project &gt; Clean" the following errors popped up:<br /><pre>...SDK Manager] Warning: Ignoring platform '.DS_Store', not a folder.<br /></pre>Well this was solved quickly. Apparently for some reason OSX added the .DS_Store folder (which is a hidden one) to the platforms folder of the Android SDK. A quick <code>rm -rf .DS_Store</code> fixed the issue.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />The next problem I encountered was the following message which hindered my project to build correctly:<br /><pre>Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: null</pre>Apparently the problem was related to the fact that my Android project referenced another Java project containing shared classes. Removing and re-attaching the reference didn't solve the problem. Neither did a clean in Eclipse.<br />Fortunately Xav, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> user and Android SDK Tech Lead at Google Inc posted that they released &nbsp;a new version 8.0.1 of the Android Eclipse ADT, specifically for fix this issue. So by simply updating to the new plugin solved the issue.
