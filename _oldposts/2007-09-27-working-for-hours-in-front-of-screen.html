<div style="text-align: justify;">Then I maybe have a solution for you :) Actually a friend of mine (thanks <a href="http://manfred-ramoser.jimdo.com">Manfred</a> ;) ) send me the link to a nice program that keeps track of your working hours in front of the screen. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RvvHp7GZyII/AAAAAAAAAcM/CRDqUvQbzGA/s1600-h/workrave.gif"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RvvHp7GZyII/AAAAAAAAAcM/CRDqUvQbzGA/s400/workrave.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5114901324862441602" border="0" /></a>Especially as a software developer, you often sit for hours in front of your workstation, without having a break. That's however bad, not only for your eyes but also for your brain. It is worth to take a 10 min. break at least every two hours. This helps you relax a little and increases your concentration when you continue afterwards.<br /><a href="http://www.workrave.org/">Workrave</a> is actually the program, Manfred has given me. The program basically records the user interactions with the program, by simply recording keyboard or mouse actions. Workrave distinguishes between "<span style="font-style: italic;">Micro-breaks</span>", "<span style="font-style: italic;">Rest-breaks</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic;">daily limits</span>". All of them are clearly fully customizable, so one can for instance define a micro-break every half an hour, rest-breaks every two hours and a daily limit of about 8 hours. Workrave runs quietly in the background and when the corresponding break happens,  an information window pops up. Interestingly it doesn't only inform about the break but it additionally shows a cyber-girl (no, not in that sense :D ) doing exercises that should help you relax. In my opinion, however, these exercises shouldn't be performed AGAIN in front of the screen but it is much better to stand up and have a little walk in your room, ideally by going somewhere on the balcony and get some fresh air.<br /><a href="http://www.workrave.org/screenshots/">Here</a> you can see some screenshots in case you may be interested. Moreover since the program uses the <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK runtime environment</a> it runs on Windows as well as on UNIX systems.<br /></div>
