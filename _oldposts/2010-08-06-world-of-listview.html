I just watched Roman Guy's and Adam Powell's (two Android UI framework engineers)&nbsp;talk about the "World of ListView". They gave the presentation on this year's Google I/O event in May.<br />The talk is quite interesting and gives some explanations of the complexities behind the ListView as well as some performance considerations when you write your own custom adapter implementing the <code>getView(....)</code> method.<br />If you have already quite a lot of experiences in developing Android apps this is probably not so interesting for you, but still it may be worth scrolling through the <a href="http://goo.gl/gVPH">slides</a>.<br /><br /><b>Duration</b><br />1h<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/wDBM6wVEO70&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/wDBM6wVEO70&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
