I'd like to to do a little promotion of the <a href="http://blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day</a> since I find the idea quite useful and interesting. I've read it today on the <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2007/10/blogging-for-environment.html">Blogger Buzz</a>. <blockquote>[...] If you have a blog and want to join in, all you have to do is use that day to post something related to the environment, in whatever way, shape, or form you prefer. You can pick an environmental issue that has meaning for you and let us know why it's important. Organize a beach or neighborhood cleanup and tell us about it. If you're into fiction writing, give us a story with an environmental theme. Have a podcast, videoblog, or photoblog? Join the fun! The idea here is to have a mass effect on public awareness by sharing as many ideas in as many ways as possible. [...]</blockquote>The idea is basically that all of the bloggers around the world write for one single theme, which is<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/Rwx3e7GZydI/AAAAAAAAAg8/MBcs8TzAk4w/s1600-h/blogAction.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/Rwx3e7GZydI/AAAAAAAAAg8/MBcs8TzAk4w/s400/blogAction.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5119598249557739986" border="0" /></a> the <span style="font-style: italic;">environment</span> for this year. The day takes place at 15th October.
