I finally got a broadband internet connection at home :) For those who don't know it: I actually live on about 1,100 meters above see level and so I had to content myself with a normal 56K<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R5j4ibu_iEI/AAAAAAAAA-M/lzRglCCzXwk/s1600-h/speedCheck.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R5j4ibu_iEI/AAAAAAAAA-M/lzRglCCzXwk/s400/speedCheck.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5159146643597002818" border="0" /></a> ISDN connection. Now the necessary technical facilities have been created and I finally got an ADSL connection, Alice 7 Mega, although I don't really know what they understand with 7 MB ;)<br />I just wanted to do some checks on the speed of my connection and found <a href="http://www.speedtest.net">Speedtest.net</a>, a quite nice page which may be interesting for some of you out there. So I thought it may be worth to quickly write a post.
