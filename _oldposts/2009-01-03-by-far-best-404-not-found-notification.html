I just wanted to download a zip-file from a url provided by one of my university professors, but sadly the URL didn't exist and a "page not found" message was displayed to me. But take a look at the 404 page, it's really funny. Not just the standard plain old formal pages :)<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.vrmedialab.dk/%CB%9Cvrpp/download/3dvdm-2.3.1.tar.gz">http://www.vrmedialab.dk/%CB%9Cvrpp/download/3dvdm-2.3.1.tar.gz</a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />I had to post this :)<br />(Now I have to search for the correct URL :( ) </div>
