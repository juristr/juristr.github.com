Today I discovered that Launchy (my favorite key stroker) is now also available for Linux. I was able to install it with three commands.<br /><ol><li>Go to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132975">Launchy SourceForge website</a></li><li> Download the Linux version</li><li>Unpack it to some desired location</li><li>Execute:<br /><br /><br /><pre class="code">sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libboost-dev g++&nbsp;</pre></li><li>Execute:<br /><br /><br /><pre class="code">make<br /></pre></li><li>Execute:<br /><br /><br /><pre class="code">sudo make install<br /></pre></li></ol>It should appear then on your top-left menu "Applications/Accessories". Start it and change the short-key since I think the standard one "Alt+Space" is already taken under Linux.<br />Launchy easies your life in front of the computer really. Since I installed it under Windows I did never touch the Start/Programs menu again. Just press Alt+Space (or your custom short-key), type in your program (or even folder) and press enter.
