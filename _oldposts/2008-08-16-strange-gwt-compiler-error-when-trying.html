I'm currently working on a project on my own where I'm developing a rich client by using the <a href="http://code.google.com/gwt">Google Web toolkit</a> and a server using the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring application framework</a>. The client/server communication is implemented by using the GWT-RPC mechanism. Today however I experienced a strange compilation error when I started to do some experiments in serializing and transferring Java objects (POJOs) to the server. The GWT compiler issued a strange error saying<br /><blockquote>Type [yourpackagename.classname] <x> was not serializable and has no concrete serializable subtypes.</x></blockquote>The error is misleading and strange since my class actually implements the java.io.Serializable interface. By the way GWT <a href="http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=78126">doesn't really support the Serializable</a> interface. It has just been introduced after some requests from developers to enable class reusing between applications. Prior to this change, classes had to implement the com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.IsSerializable interface. I also tried that, with no success.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">import java.io.Serializable;<br /><br />public class ItemLabel implements Serializable {<br /> private String name;<br /> <br /> public ItemLabel(String name) {<br />  this.name = name;<br /> }<br /><br /> public String getName() {<br />  return name;<br /> }<br /><br /> public void setName(String name) {<br />  this.name = name;<br /> }<br /> <br />}</pre>Then I finally found the problem. It seems as if the serialization process needs an empty constructor. After changing my above code into the following, everything worked out fine.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">import java.io.Serializable;<br /><br />public class ItemLabel implements Serializable {<br /> private String name;<br /> <br /> public ItemLabel(){}<br /> <br /> public ItemLabel(String name) {<br />  this.name = name;<br /> }<br /><br /> public String getName() {<br />  return name;<br /> }<br /><br /> public void setName(String name) {<br />  this.name = name;<br /> }<br /> <br />}</pre>
