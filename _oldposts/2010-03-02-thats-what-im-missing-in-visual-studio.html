Visual Studio is great in doing many things as for instance in integrating with other MS products (obviously) or with debugging. The VS debugger is one of the best I've seen till now (using different IDEs).<br /><br />One thing however I always again miss is having better code editor support. I'm also using Eclipse heavily and the code support which is given there is just amazing and by far better than in Visual Studio. Examples are not only the refactorings, but also shortcuts for jumping to classes / methods which in VS is only available through 3rd-party plugins. Ok...you can use the dropdown box on top...but it is far from usable (have to switch to mouse, etc...).<br /><br />Another example I came across today in Eclipse is the following. I was just writing an argument matcher to be provided to <a href="http://mockito.org/">Mockito</a> in one of my test cases. I started with the following<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/S42HYuj-S3I/AAAAAAAACiw/2Wr1yBmTA6o/s1600-h/EclipseCodeSupport1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="167" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/S42HYuj-S3I/AAAAAAAACiw/2Wr1yBmTA6o/s400/EclipseCodeSupport1.png" width="400" /></a></div>Note, argument is of type object, so I did a check using the <code>instanceof</code> ("is" in C#) keyword wrapped within an if clause. I then continued to write <code>argument.getLabels()</code>,...<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/S42IE9Hik5I/AAAAAAAACi0/mdIURjeItN8/s1600-h/EclipseCodeSupport2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="182" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/S42IE9Hik5I/AAAAAAAACi0/mdIURjeItN8/s400/EclipseCodeSupport2.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />...not recognizing that <code>getLabels()</code> is actually a method of SourceCodeItem, wherefore I have to cast <code>argument</code> to <code>SourceCodeItem</code> first. But...wait; strangely Eclipse provided <code>getLabels()</code> in its suggestions as if it would be a valid method of <code>argument</code>?? Confirming it...<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/S42IrtmruJI/AAAAAAAACi4/REulHGL0lxs/s1600-h/EclipseCodeSupport3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="183" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/S42IrtmruJI/AAAAAAAACi4/REulHGL0lxs/s400/EclipseCodeSupport3.png" width="400" /></a></div>...Eclipse does the cast automatically for me!! That's what I call great support....I love it!
