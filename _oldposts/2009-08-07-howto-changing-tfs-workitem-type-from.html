Recently I found a bug while implementing another feature and in order to not forget it, I created a new work item for our Team Foundation bug tracking system. After specifying the details and adding some screenshots I recognized that I accidentally created a task instead of a bug. Easy I thought, just change the workitem type from "task" to "bug". You would like that, woudn't you? :) Actually I got surprised, there is no immediate way to directly change the workitem type. I even tried to use the Team Foundation Excel add-on, referenced my workitem list and tried to change it there, but it gave me an error.<br /><br />The only way to be able to change the workitem from a task to a bug is the following way:<br /><ol><li>Within Visual Studio, right-click on your workitem and select "Create Copy of Work Item..."<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SnmU2x8L8MI/AAAAAAAACbw/1TaFG85MfDY/s1600-h/copyWorkItem.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SnmU2x8L8MI/AAAAAAAACbw/1TaFG85MfDY/s400/copyWorkItem.jpg" /></a></li><li>The following dialog window will pop up where you can then change the work item type:<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SnmVbEnp5eI/AAAAAAAACb4/4h20H5ekYqk/s1600-h/copyWorkItemDialog.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SnmVbEnp5eI/AAAAAAAACb4/4h20H5ekYqk/s320/copyWorkItemDialog.jpg" /></a><br /></li><li>A new work item will then be created and your old one (the task) will have a reference to it in the "Links" tab:<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SnmV6sxMShI/AAAAAAAACcA/9vzWSKYq08s/s1600-h/copyWorkItem_linkToCopiedBug.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SnmV6sxMShI/AAAAAAAACcA/9vzWSKYq08s/s400/copyWorkItem_linkToCopiedBug.jpg" /></a><br /></li></ol>You can then set your old work item (the task) to "closed" status.<br /><br />This way is quite uncomfortable, but I guess they've chosen this kind of implementation for always keeping track of any kind of action that is going on any work item. Although they could have just put a reference into the work item history as it is done for changes on any work item other fields.
