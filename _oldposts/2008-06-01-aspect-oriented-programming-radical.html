<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comment</span><br />Gregor Kiczales, Professor at the University of British Columbia, talks at Google about Aspect Oriented Programming. The video is very interesting and highlights a lot of advantages in using AOP. He demonstrates how you would be able to implement the Observer pattern without having to directly touch the involved objects. I actually have to try it out. Moreover he talks about how you could enforce architecture in your project or implement logging. I actually wanted to implement logging with Spring AOP when working on my thesis project, however unfortunately due to time constraints I wasn't able to try it out fully.<br />If this sounds interesting to you, just watch the video.<br /><span id="short-desc"></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration</span><br />57 min 18 sec<br /><br /><embed id="VideoPlayback" style="width: 400px; height: 326px;" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="fs=true" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid=8566923311315412414&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8566923311315412414&amp;q=Aspect+Oriented+Programming%3A+Radical+Research+in+Modularity&amp;ei=1GwcSK6lJo2W2wKpjb3MAQ">External Link</a></span>
