Two weeks are missing for my bachelor thesis presentation. Everything has been handed in fine and on date, and now I'm again sitting in front of my screen, trying to fit my presentation in the ten (much toooo short) minutes. It's incredible how short they are :( . I have quite a hard time to compress everything such that it still preserves its meaning... Anyway, I have to continue now...Wish me good luck :D
