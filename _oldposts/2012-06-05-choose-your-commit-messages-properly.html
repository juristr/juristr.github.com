<div class="intro">I wrote already <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2008/05/best-practices-vcs-usage-flowchart.html" target="_blank">a couple</a> <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2009/01/best-practices-tracking-information-on.html" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2011/08/check-in-small-pieces-to-your-vcs.html" target="_blank">posts</a> about version control stuff and best practices related with it. So today, what about proper commit messages?</div><a name='more'></a><br />How often did you take a look at the history of <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2009/01/best-practices-tracking-information-on.html" target="_blank">some file/folder</a>?? It's just the best backup system you could have and that's one of the main purposes of a VCS (forget about branching, merging etc for a while ;) ). And if you did look at your commit messages, were they meaningful?? Did they make any sense to you?? So often they don't, right? Messages like... <br /><ul><li>method 'SomeMethodInAClass' modified</li><li>production-build</li><li>added some files</li><li>fixed some bugs</li><li>...</li></ul><div>...they just don't say anything, right?? You have to open some kind of comparison editor and directly look at <b>what actually changed</b>.<br /><h2> Instead...</h2>When looking at the 1st sample comment "method 'SomeMethodInAClass' modified", what would you think about this comment as a (more expressive) alternative:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Bugfix: changed LINQ query to return all entities EXCEPT the current one</i></div><br />Now assume you're currently searching for an issue you're having related to the reading of some entities...I <b>bet this message</b>&nbsp;would jump on your eyes immediately!<br /><h2>So..</h2>..the history excerpt from your VCS should <i>nearly</i> be something that you could directly copy and paste as a public version history on your webpage.</div>
