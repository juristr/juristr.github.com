Google just released an new interesting feature in relation with its <a href="http://talk.google.com/">instant messaging client</a>(s) (Google Talk, Google Talk Gadget, Gmail Chat). You have now the possibility to place a so-called "chatback" on your website or blog. I just added it on the upper right gadget of my blog to test it ;) . It is basically an iframe which you can get from <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/service/badge/New">this</a> site. People can then click on the link inside the speech bubble and start chatting directly with you. I find it an interesting and uncomplicated way for getting in contact with your blog readers. Lets see how it works :)<br />It may be interesting to know that if you set your current status to busy, your blog readers will not be able to get in contact with you since the link in the iframe will be deactivated.
