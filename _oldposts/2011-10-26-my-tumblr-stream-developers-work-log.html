You may have noted the diminishing frequency of posts being published on my blog here. Well, sadly I'm currently quite busy at work as well as privately. I'm currently relocating (out of my parent's home :)) as now also my girlfriend finally graduated about a week ago in MSc in Global Management and Markets - Major in Entrepreneurship (with 110/110 - congrats btw :)). And then there is <a href="http://www.yoseikan-nals.it/">Yoseikan</a>, where I have to prepare myself for the upcoming fighting season.<br /><span style="background-color: transparent;">Anyway, don't worry, t</span><span style="background-color: transparent;">here is a huge amount of posts in the draft state, waiting to be published. The point is that on this blog here I'd like to publish more elaborated, well thought articles that cover some interesting topic. This implies that does posts usually take a bit longer to write down (-&gt; hence the long draft list).</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="30" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f9F2f6eO11I/TqcrDY0ZfzI/AAAAAAAAC6Q/PZpKUTMatEo/s320/socialnets.png" width="320" /></div><span style="background-color: transparent;"></span><br /><a name='more'></a><span style="background-color: transparent;">Often however, I find interesting stuff that's worth sharing which might be short comments, videos or even just links to nice blog articles I encounter while working/browsing the web. </span><a href="http://twitter.com/juristr" style="background-color: transparent;">Twitter</a><span style="background-color: transparent;"> is an option but its char limit is not always suitable. As a result I started to experiment with a </span><b style="background-color: transparent;">parallel Tumblr blog</b><span style="background-color: transparent;"> to this one here. Tumblr's philosophy exactly matches this need for sharing short posts, links or videos.</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Tumblr lets you effortlessly share anything. Post text, photos, quotes, links, music, and videos, from your browser, phone, desktop, email, or wherever you happen to be. You can customize everything, from colors, to your theme's HTML. And we're here to help!</blockquote>Let's see whether Tumblr works for me. So, you can follow me on<br /><ul><li><b>This blog</b> here ;)</li><li><b><a href="http://twitter.com/juristr">Twitter</a></b><br />You will get my personal status updates, links, Tumblr posts as well as Blog posts published here.</li><li><a href="http://developerlog.tumblr.com/"><b>Tumblr</b></a><br />This is the new blog where I'd like to share more quick and concise infos like links, videos, short comments, code pieces etc.</li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Juri-Strumpflohners-TechBlog/157432560964701"><b>Facebook: Juri Strumpflohner's TechBlog Fanpage</b></a><br />Similar as Twitter, an aggregation of my blog posts as well as those from Tumblr. This is just for convenience if you'd like to have them nicely integrated into your daily Facebook news stream. (Just click "Like" on the Facebook box in the sidebar of this blog).</li><li><b>Google+ Public Stream</b><br />Well, yes. You might search and follow me there as well but sincerely I don't use it that much as other networks, yet.</li></ul><div>Enjoy.</div>
