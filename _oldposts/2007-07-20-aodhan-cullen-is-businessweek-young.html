<div style="text-align: justify;">Probably you'll ask yourself now: Who is Aodhan Cullen...should I know him?<br />Well, the word "StatCounter" will tell you for sure more...and if not...then it's worth to continue to read here. Cullen is actually the founder of StatCounter,<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RqDpRnE2K9I/AAAAAAAAAJI/TXYmkz-kEQ4/s1600-h/statcounter_logo.gif"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RqDpRnE2K9I/AAAAAAAAAJI/TXYmkz-kEQ4/s400/statcounter_logo.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5089324067685018578" border="0" /></a> an online service for tracking website-visitors.<br />A month ago I received a mail from <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> (as also all other <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> account owners), asking to vote for Cullen, as he had been nominated for BusinessWeek's  "<span style="font-style: italic;">Young Entrepreneur Award</span>". It seems as if my vote has helped :) , since today I received the mail that he actually won. And his story is really impressing...When he was only 12 years old, he started his first business and with 16 years he launched the Dublin-based <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a>. If you want to read more about that...continue <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2007/gb20070717_028843.htm?chan=globalbiz_special+report+--+top+young+entrepreneurs+2007_special+report+--+top+young+entrepreneurs+2007">here</a>.<br /></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I actually started this post, since I'm using StatCounter now for a while and I recognized that I've never written anything about it. So...a little bit of advertising for a service that provides great functionalities and is totally free is never bad.<br /></div><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is StatCounter?</span><br /><span style=";font-family:verdana;font-size:100%;"  ></span><p><span style="font-size:100%;"></span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size:100%;">A <b>free</b> yet reliable <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/free_invisible_web_tracker.html">invisible web tracker</a>, highly configurable <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/free_hit_counter.html">hit counter</a> and real-time detailed <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/free_web_stats.html">web stats</a>.

Below there is a snapshot of the Map of this blog here (seems as if some Google employee has taken a look at my blog ;) ):<br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RqD04nE2K-I/AAAAAAAAAJQ/WK0l3GivILY/s1600-h/statcounter_map.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RqD04nE2K-I/AAAAAAAAAJQ/WK0l3GivILY/s400/statcounter_map.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5089336832327822306" border="0" /></a><br /></div><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent Visitor Activity</span></span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: justify;">The "Recent Visitor Activity" area is nothing else than the list-view of the "Recent Visitor Map" but anyway extremely useful to quickly see the last few entries. Beside the location from which the visitor came, I find the referring URL specially useful...<br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><a dragover="true" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RqD77nE2K_I/AAAAAAAAAJY/wAymE07EIug/s1600-h/visitoractivity.jpg"><img dragover="true" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; display: block; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RqD77nE2K_I/AAAAAAAAAJY/wAymE07EIug/s400/visitoractivity.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5089344580448824306" border="0" /></a></div></div><div dragover="true" style="text-align: left;"><br /><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blocking cookie</span></span><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">It's unobtrusive...but I personally find it great, if not one of the most beneficial feature: the blocking cookie. As you can see from the picture, on the overview page, where all your project<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RqECA3E2LAI/AAAAAAAAAJg/uGnRFwGRnjI/s1600-h/statcountermain.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RqECA3E2LAI/AAAAAAAAAJg/uGnRFwGRnjI/s400/statcountermain.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5089351267712904194" border="0" /></a> are listed, there is a link called "Blocking cookie". Clicking on it, you will be redirected to a page, which creates (or destroys an existing) blocking cookie on your computer, having the effect that your own visits to your webpage won't be logged.<br />This is actually the feature which led me to the decision to use StatCounter instead of <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>. Analytics has very nice features, specially after the last huge update, they have added a lot of nice flash pieces showing very detailed statistics etc...However the problem there is that they allow only  to filter out specific host-names or ip-addresses / ip-ranges. But if you're only a normal, little user behind your computer, writing useless posts to your blog and you don't have a static ip-address, but a dynamic one, which is assigned to you automatically by our ISP...then this feature doesn't help much. For a company with their own server with static ip etc...it may be great, however.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" >Other features</span><br />As I said, I just listed my top 3 features, which I use most or find most useful.
