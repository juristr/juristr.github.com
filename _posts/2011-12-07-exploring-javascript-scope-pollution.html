<p>John Resig has written a very interesting article (I'm not able to find just now) on how the current scope might get polluted if you're accidentally invoking a function intended as an object constructor function without using the "new" keyword in front. Here's a simple example that illustrates the issue.</p>

Basically consider you have the following, extremely simple code:<br /><pre class="brush:javascript">var Person = function(first, second){<br />   this.name = first + " " + second;<br />};<br /><br />//using it somewhere<br />var name = "Juri";<br />var aPerson = new Person("Peter", "Oberhofer"); //invoking the constructor function<br /><br />document.write(name);<br /></pre>Now as expected you'd assume "Juri" to be printed as you don't do anything else than printing the current variable <code>name</code>.<br /><br />Now what happens if you forget to use the "new" keyword like <br /><pre class="brush:javascript">var name="Juri";<br />var aPerson = Person("Peter", "Oberhofer"); //attention, no "new" keyword<br /><br />document.write(name);<br /></pre>What would be the result? Can you guess it? It would be: <code>Peter Oberhofer</code>. Strange, right? The problem is that given the fact you didn't specify the "new" keyword the function <code>Person</code> <b>wrote on the global namespace</b> when executing <code>this.name = ...</code>. The declaration of <code>var name = "Juri"</code>&nbsp;is in this case on the global namespace as well, hence without specifying the <code>new</code> keyword you overwrite the previous declaration, resulting in <code>Peter Oberhofer</code>&nbsp;to be printed out.<br /><br />You can check out a live sample here: <a href="http://jsbin.com/ozawep/4/edit#javascript,live">http://jsbin.com/ozawep/4/edit#javascript,live</a>.
