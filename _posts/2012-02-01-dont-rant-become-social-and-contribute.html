<p>Todays web experience has changed a lot and so has done coding as well. Everything is around being social, interacting with people through social networks, blogs or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">online communities.</a>&nbsp;I love Open Source, mainly because you can learn so much <a href="http://source.android.com/" target="_blank">from others' code</a> or even just inspect it when you experience problems. Still, contributing was always a bit cumbersome in my opinion. GitHub changed that!</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://api.ning.com/files/vKABSA7L5uYc4QD1-hZ7l1MRtnhY-oi1s-Bp2m0Oawip4tdJ-e-2tbOMVJTJy4hoSxTpZadeB*irv1TcIUgFwPrK*kHjey9J/githuboctacat.jpg" /></div>The more I dive into using <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2010/11/juri-goes-git-first-steps.html" target="_blank">Git</a>, the more I enjoy the nature of a distributed VCS. Today for instance I found a very simple bug in the <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/" target="_blank">jQuery Validation plugin</a>&nbsp;while browsing through its source. It was nothing special, but a grammar error in one of the german localization files. So, what could I have done? Well yes, just ignore it, open an issue in the according issue repository, download the source and fix it for my projects or...just <b>fork the repo, fix it and submit a pull request</b>!<br /><br />So did I and so should you! If you're new, just get started with these steps here.<br /><h2>       Setup your Git Tools</h2>If you haven't yet setup your workstation to be used with Git, just follow the <a href="http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect/" target="_blank">instructions on the official site here</a>. There is a very nice step by step explanation with screenshots and everything you'd need to have a smooth setup experience.<br /><h2>      Fork the Repo</h2>Go and fork the repository where you found the bug. In my case it was the one of <a href="https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation" target="_blank">jQuery Validation</a>. Again, if you don't have any experience in that, just follow the <a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/" target="_blank">guide</a>. <br /><h2>      Get your repo and fix the bug</h2>Get the source of your (just forked) GitHub repository. In my case it was something like<br /><pre class="brush:bash">git clone git@github.com:juristr/jquery-validation</pre>Then just fix the bug, commit the changes and push them back to your repo.<br /><pre class="brush:bash">git commit -a -m "Fixed a grammar error in the german localization"<br />git push origin master</pre><h2>   Send a Pull Request</h2>The last step is to send a pull request to the upstream repository, namely the original repo (jQuery-validation) from which we created the fork before. Again, <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/" target="_blank">here's the doc</a>.<br /><h2>  The Result</h2>A <a href="https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/311" target="_blank">nice thanks from the author</a> and your bugfix has been pulled into the master branch.<br /><br />Love it!
