Nice talk about how many businesses get motivation wrong.

### Key points

1. Those 20th century rewards, those motivators we think are a natural part of business do work, but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances.
2. Those if-then awards often destroy creativity.
3. The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments, but that unseen intrinsic drive, drive to do things for the own sake. The drive to do things because they matter.

The science knows and confirms this already, but there is a mismatch between what science knows and what most businesses currently do.
