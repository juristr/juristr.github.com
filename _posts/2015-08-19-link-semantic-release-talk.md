Kent C. Dodds talks with Stephan Bönnemann, the creator of [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
Semantic-release

- automates the releasing process (to NPM,...)
- automatically determines the **correct semantic version** based on [conventional commit messages](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)
- generates a nice changelog on GitHub
- is even able to detect breaking changes based on failing tests executed on Travis
- ...
- much more to come (just check out the official repo)

I didn't yet watch the video, but I'm sure it's worth it!
