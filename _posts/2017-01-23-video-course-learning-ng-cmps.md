At the beginning of the course you will be given an introduction to the modern frontend tooling, including **TypeScript**, new ES2015+ features and SystemJS. You will be learning about **component based architectures** which is an important toolkit of every frontend developers. From section to section you will discover new concepts around Angular components such as **data flow, events, styling, content projection** and many more. Besides that, you will learn about unit **testing, debugging and end-to-end testing** of Angular components. Finally, you will get an outlook on the potential of Angular, but creating a small hybrid mobile application with **Ionic 2** and executing Angular on the server, using **Angular Universal**.

- Refactor and upgrade an Angular 1.x application to Angular
- Design reusable components by understanding how data flows in and out of them and by leveraging advanced Angular template techniques

## Buy the course! How can I get it?

Great :smiley:. This video has been created by me in collaboration with [PacktPub](https://www.packtpub.com/). It's the 2nd edition of the "Learning Angular 2 directives" course. A fresh update covering all the latest changes after the final release of Angular version 2. Lots of sweat, but totally worth it and I'm glad it's out now :smiley:.

That said, it also means this is a paid course, currently sold by PacktPub. Still interested? Then go ahead :smiley:

## Thanks!

Many thanks to my girl which gave me all the support I could imagine during this quite intense phase of producing this video course.  
Also, thanks to [Nathan Walker](https://twitter.com/wwwalkerrun) for doing the tech review. I'm so glad I had him on board as he's such an active and valuable Angular community member right now :+1:.
