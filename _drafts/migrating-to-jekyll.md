I recently saw more and more people, especially developers, to move away from popular blog engines like Blogger, Wordpress or Windows Live Writer to a more simple, yet even more powerful blogging method: static site generators. Although I migrated more than 1 1/2 years ago away from Blogger to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), I thought I might take the occasion and write a little follow up on my migration.

About a month ago, the popular blogger and now GitHub employee [Phil Haack](http://twitter.com/haacked) migrated to [Jekyll and GitHub hosting](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/).

## Jekyll because..

..of GitHub hosting. Yes, really. I actually didn't try lots of static site generators and hence, I cannot evaluate whether there are better alternatives than Jekyll. However, one of the great things about it is that you can simply push it to GitHub and they'll generate the static sites and care about the publishing.
