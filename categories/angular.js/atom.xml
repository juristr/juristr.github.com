      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you heard about Angular 2 and that it will be totally different. Forget everything you know and start from scratch 😮 . Jokes apart, if you have taken a closer look you already know that, yes, it will be new, things will be different (as it&amp;rsquo;s mostly the case with new stuff), but many concepts will still be there.</description>

      <title>Learning Angular: Verifying whether a function has been passed to my directive&#39;s isolated scope</title>
      <link>https://juristr.com/blog/2015/02/learning-ng-verify-presence-of-directive-props/</link>

      <guid>https://juristr.com/blog/2015/02/learning-ng-verify-presence-of-directive-props/</guid>
      <description>When you create isolated directives, you usually use the scope property to define your directive&#39;s external API. Some of the APIs properties might be mandatory while others are optional and based on that state, your directive might react differently.</description>

      <description>Angular directives can have a separate, isolated scope, which is even the suggested approach most of the time. And they can have directive controllers. But&amp;hellip;how do I access the directive&amp;rsquo;s scope variables from the directive controller and vice-versa?</description>

      <description>This might create quite some debugging headaches, especially in a larger application. Things don&amp;rsquo;t bind properly, have different data on the scope than you&amp;rsquo;d expect etc.</description>

      <description>Angular data-binding seems magic, but obviously isn&#39;t. You have to give it a chance to do its work. As such, watch out and think about the difference &#34;</description>

      <description>Test code has to be treated like production code. Obviously we cannot charge the customer for it, it&amp;rsquo;s something that helps us developers to make sure we keep our codebase healthy, which ultimately is the responsibility we have towards our customers.</description>

      <description>Startup time is crucial for a proper user experience and that&amp;rsquo;s where many JavaScript SPA really fail. Even though you might (and definitely should) apply code minification and bundling mechanisms, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to load your entire application right upfront.</description>
