      <description>Till recently,&amp;nbsp;(IMHO)&amp;nbsp;Android Developers had a very bad experience in designing graphical UIs for their Android apps. Personally I never relied on the graphical designer that was provided with the Android Eclipse plugin.</description>

      <description>For my current Android research project I needed to copy an APK to the /system/app folder. Now for that you need root rights. Well, that shouldn&#39;t be a problem, right?</description>

      <description>Couple of time ago I wrote a blog post describinghow you can use Dropbox for deploying your Android APK basically over-the-air to your device. That involved copying your APK to a dedicated Dropbox folder that can then be accessed from your Android device to install it.</description>

      <title>Android: HowTo Detect Installed SQLite DB Version</title>
      <link>https://juristr.com/blog/2011/01/android-howto-detect-installed-sqlite/</link>

      <description>As you might already know, Android comes with a preinstalled SQLite database. This is quite handy because you can rely on it without the need to care about installing a DB along with your application (although you can, standalone, small DB&#39;s of course like HSQLDB).</description>

      <description>Today I took the chance (and a bit of free time) to upgrade to the latest Android SDK release, namely Gingerbread. Experience has shown that you better back up your Eclipse as well as currently installed Android SDK folder, especially if you&#39;re working on an important project (which I consider my Master thesis project to be kind of ;)).</description>

      <title>HowTo: Get an Android app&#39;s database from the emulator</title>

      <guid>https://juristr.com/blog/2010/06/howto-get-android-apps-database-from/</guid>
      <description>Most apps need a database for storing their data onto the device in a structured form. Android&#39;s natively supported DB is SQLite. Now of course if you develop an app you&#39;ll probably have the need for inspecting the stored data during development.</description>

      <description>Android View classes expose an onTouchEvent(MotionEvent ev) method. As the name already suggests, by overriding this method you can handle touch events done by the user on the current view.</description>
