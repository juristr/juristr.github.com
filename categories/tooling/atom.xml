    I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the release of my latest Egghead course on “Scale React development with Nx”. Let me briefly dive into what the course is about, why I targeted it to React.js developers and who should watch it!

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    You know those moments when your Selenium based test succeeds locally, but for some weird reason fails on CI? The only hope: screenshots of the failed run! Let&amp;rsquo;s quickly have a look at how we can tell GitLab to store those screenshots on a failed run.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    One of the powerful pillars of the open-source &lt;a href=&#34;https://nx.dev&#34;&gt;Nx monorepo toolkit&lt;/a&gt; is its dependency graph. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look into how we can leverage it in our own scripts.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this already happened to you as well. You pull down the latest &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch or jump to some feature branch and you start getting weird errors. Until only later you recognize you forgot to execute an &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s look into how we can avoid that.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    I think partial commits should be avoided as they might lead to inconsistent commits if you don&amp;rsquo;t test them properly. But sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re handy too. In this article I&amp;rsquo;m quickly showing how partial commits can be done in Webstorm.

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    Jest has become the goto testing framework in the frontend space, whether it is for React or for Angular. In Nx it is even the default choice when generating a new Angular app. Debugging can be a bit more cumbersome though, in contrast to Karma. Let&amp;rsquo;s see.

      <description>I guess that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to start talking about the importance of testing in the software development process. There are couple of different kind of tests which I&amp;rsquo;m not going to mention now, but generally speaking a good test should verify the correct implementation of the business requirements but also test the software on its boundaries and edge cases.</description>
