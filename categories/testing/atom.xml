      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;article-intro&#34;&gt;
    Writing automated tests has become like a standard practice in software development and (should be) an integral part of a healthy software development process. Testing (in particular automated testing) can come with different flavors and at different levels. In this article I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a quick overview of automated UI or end-2-end testing with Cypress.

      <description>Every Angular CLI generated project comes already with a test setup in place using Karma. I think the default &#34;progress&#34; test result report is not as nice however.</description>

      <description>Beside giving you an immediate feedback, unit tests are extremely useful as a regression test suite. They basically build a safety net around your code, giving you the freedom to apply changes without breaking anything existing.</description>

      <description>Your unit tests should be as descriptive as possible. The feedback they give you should be so clear you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to fire up the debugger and step one by one through the code to inspect your local variables.</description>

      <description>I guess that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to start talking about the importance of testing in the software development process. There are couple of different kind of tests which I&amp;rsquo;m not going to mention now, but generally speaking a good test should verify the correct implementation of the business requirements but also test the software on its boundaries and edge cases.</description>

      <description>Automated testing is hard! Therefore, if you&#39;re about to learn it, just keep going. Resist the initial learning curve as afterwards it&#39;ll allow you to adopt a completely different programming style.</description>

      <description>Using a dependency injection framework can greatly facilitate your code&#39;s testability&amp;nbsp;in that you don&#39;t have any &#34;glue&#34; code for managing a classes&#39; dependency that needs to be mocked (if even possible) when writing unit tests.</description>

      <description>When &#34;seriously&#34; developing JavaScript applications we obviously need to write tests. Being a fully dynamic language (similar as Ruby), tests are more necessary than ever since there is no compiler that checks for you all the silly mistakes before you run your code the first time.</description>

      <description>Maintainability is of major importance in software development. Usually writing tests against your codebase increases maintainability in that it gives you some degree of freedom in making changes, at the same time assuring you did not break any existing logic.</description>

      <description>During unit testing it is common to substitute dependencies with a test double (see Martin Fowler&#39;s disambiguation). This is necessary for isolating the tested environment and consequently also the potential source of error in case of a test failure.</description>
