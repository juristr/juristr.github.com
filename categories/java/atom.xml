      <description>If you&#39;re developing on Eclipse RCP applications it may be interesting to save the perspective layout and open views of the user s.t. when he launches the application the next time, everything looks as before.</description>

      <description>Today morning when starting a general build of the project I&#39;m currently working on, I got an error saying &#34;unknown protocol: d&#34;. It was strange since I couldn&#39;t remember of any big changes made and the build didn&#39;t also fail the last time.</description>
